# Jeff's Journal

**Prior to 3/28/2023**
As a team, we collaborated to come up with our application concept, identified its core features, and developed wireframes to visualize its design. We also established our project's minimum viable product, outlined our stretch goals, and defined the endpoints required to achieve our desired functionality.

**3/28/2023**
Working collaboratively as a team, we began by focusing on the backend of our project, where we deliberated on our database design and implemented it using PostgreSQL. Afterwards, we established the necessary routers and query directories, along with their respective files, to create a robust and organized backend infrastructure.

**3/29/2023**
Throughout the development process, each team member contributed to the creation of multiple endpoints, while actively collaborating on user and post functionality. Specifically, I implemented the get all users and create a user endpoint, also worked on the update post feature. Once all endpoints were completed, the team integrated their work and merged the changes onto the main branch.

**3/30/2023**
As a team, we began working on the location endpoints, with each team member contributing to its implementation. Specifically, I focused on developing the update one location endpoint for the project.

**3/31/2023**
As a team, we initiated work on the fish endpoints and each team member contributed to their implementation. In particular, I worked on developing the delete fish endpoints for the project. Additionally, we began setting up our back-end authentication, which included the integration of the jwtdown authenticator.

**4/03/2023**
We added token protection to our user endpoints.
I was responsible for implementing the necessary authentication functionality for the get_one_user endpoint.

**4/04/2023**
We as a team finished protecting all the endpoints for post.

**4/05/2023**
Together as a team, we established the necessary foreign key relationships between fish and locations, as well as between users and posts. Additionally, we created a new database to link fish and locations, which allowed us to obtain specific information on a fish in a particular location. We completed all backend tasks as of today.

**4/06/2023**
Moving on to the frontend development, we installed the necessary dependencies such as tailwind. We created a dedicated Components directory and developed various files inside it. Additionally, we implemented the login and signup page along with the navbar and some styling. We began working on frontend authentication to ensure secure access to our project's features.

**4/07/2023**
Today was a productive day as we were able to successfully implement frontend authentication. Moving forward, each team member began working on their individual tasks within the React framework. Specifically, I focused on developing the home page which required my creative side.

**4/11/2023**
I completed the home page and pushed to main, my next task is to clean it up and tackle the search page.

**4/13/2023**
Completed the search page and added some info cards as well as news placeholders. Implemented search functionality to filter through database.

**4/17/2023**
We couldn't find out how to get one username from the token but tried to tackle it.
I worked on locationlist now leading to location page.

**4/18/2023**
The team were able to fetch user data from token to use on our form post.
Changed search bar to a drop down select.
Walked through steps of the deployment process, stopped on step 3.

**4/19/2023**
Worked on deployment, but got stuck on step 3.
Waiting for help from TA.
Figured out a solution to the login issue, but it isn't the cleanest solution.

**4/20/2023**
Today, we worked on deployment and unit testing.
Waiting on help from TA for both of these tasks.
Personal tasks, replace placeholder pictures and redesign LocationList page.

**4/24/2023**
Had a meeting with TA to help with deployment. We were able to deploy our backend, and fix all our deployment bugs.
