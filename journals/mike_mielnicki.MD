# Mike's Journal

**Prior to 3/28/2023**
The team and myself worked on making our idea for the project and brain stormed the creation of our wireframe. We created a detailed excalidraw drawing and worked collaboratively to come to a clear vision for our project. We outlined our MVP and our stretch goals.

**3/28/2023**
As a group, we worked on the start of our backend, discussed our database, And set it up with PostgresSQL. We then created our routers and queries directory and the related files inside the directories.

**3/29/2023**
All of us created multiple endpoints as we worked with users and posts.
I implemented the user delete endpoint and posts delete endpoint.
The team finished users and posts endpoint and merged onto main.

**3/30/2023**
We started on the location endpoints as a team.
I implemented the get one post endpoint. In addtion, revised all our endpoints, and added POST
and get all locations.

**3/31/2023**
We started on the fish endpoints as a team.
I implemented the get one fish endpoint and post fish endpoint.
We also got started on our back-end authentication as we added jwtdown authenticator.

**4/03/2023**
We added token protection to our get one user endpoint.

**4/04/2023**
The team finished protecting all the endpoints for post.
I added the auth get all posts endpoint.
In addition, we added another endpoint for users for
getting a specific user's posts.

**4/05/2023**
Together we worked on creating the foreign key relationships between fish and locations, and users and posts.
We needed these to associate both the fish and locations together, and
users and posts together. We created another database to link the fish and locations to
grab a specific fish from a location.
In addition, we finished everything on the backend.

**4/06/2023**
We started on our frontend and installed react-router-dom and tailwind for our stylings. We created our components in a Components directory and created some files in there. We also added the login/signup page and navbar and some stylings.
We also started tackling frontend authentication.

**4/07/2023**
Today we got frontend authentication to work. Everyone on the team started working on their individual react work. I began my
work on the PostForm page

**4/11/2023**
Team completed home page. I started work on the PostForm page for submitting new posts.

**4/12/2023**
Continued work on PostForm page while we all worked on our solo parts of our project.

**4/17/2023**
The team and I were figuring out how to get one user and were not able to implement it today.
I am nearing completion on my PostForm page.

**4/18/2023**
The team and I were able to figure gettting one user's information by fetching from the token.
In addition, we also started our deployment process on getting it started. Currently are facing blockers
Regarding step 3/4.
**4/19/2023**
I submitted my PostForm page to main, now that we were able to get out data mapped. We had difficulty getting the data
with the Auth Token.

**4/20/2023**
Today, We all submitted our unit tests.
I submitted the Fish Get all unit test.
I worked on styling of the PostForm Submission Page.
We also created a way to get an invalid login information toast if the user tries to login with invalid credentials.

**4/21/2023**
Today we finished most of our solo portions of the project, and continued to work on deployment.
We had the day off of class, and decided it was a good time to meet up for a few hours and work on the next step of deployment
and see if we can get past our previous blockers. Began Readme.

**4/21/2023**
Today we continued to work on deployment, as I continued to work on the Readme. We had to change our API key out, and that caused some issues. The team also revised our nav bar over the weekend and it should now be responsive to the size of the users screen.

**4/22/2023**
Today I continued working on the readme, as the team continued to work on the final stage of debugging our deployment.
In addition, we are still trying to fix a mapbox error regarding deployment and our API key.

**4/23/2023**
Today I completed the readme, and we are now working on the final bugs on our project regarding deployment and the API key.
In addition, we are working on minor stretch goals at the moment that will not hinder the project if the dead line is not met prior to Friday.

**4/25/2023**
Today I revised the Readme to better fit the project parameters. We still are continuing on fixing the API key issues we were
dealing with specifically with mapbox as well. In addition, we are continuing working on minor visual improvements and bug handling as we find them.

**4/26/2023**
Today I completed the visual edits of the readme on Gitlab to better represent the data provided. We as a group did more visual tweaks to the project, and noticed more bugs here and there that are minor that we are cleaning up. Later we will be working outside of the project code, and more working on the presentation aspect of our project. In addition, we added photos that will be needed for the About us stretch goal that we are currently implementing to the project.
